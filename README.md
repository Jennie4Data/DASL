# GitHub Repository: DASL Competition Project - 3rd Place

## DASL Competition

### Overview
This repository contains my submissions for the Data Analytics Super League (DASL) competition. I am proud to share that I secured the 3rd position in the overall standings. Throughout the competition, I tackled a series of data analytics challenges, demonstrating my skills in data manipulation, SQL querying, and data cleaning with Python.

### Projects
Challenge 1: Cell Referencing
Description: In this challenge, I worked on data referencing and manipulation, gaining insights from a dataset by performing calculations and analysis using various cell referencing techniques.

Challenge 4: Movie Time - Data Cleaning with Python
Description: For this challenge, I was provided with the 'movies.csv' dataset and asked to clean it using Python. The cleaning process involved the following steps:
Removed duplicate values from the 'movies' column.
Cleaned the 'year' column to obtain the appropriate release year of the movies.
Extracted the first genre from the 'genre' column.
Cleaned the 'rating' column.
Extracted the director's name and separated it into a different column.
Separated the names of stars into individual columns.
Cleaned the 'votes,' 'runtime,' and 'gross' columns.
The final result was a cleaned version of the 'movies.csv' dataset, which is available as a cleaned CSV file in this repository.
